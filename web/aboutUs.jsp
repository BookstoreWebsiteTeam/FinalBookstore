<h1>About University Stores</h1>
<p>
    As a unit within Auxiliary Services and Programs, our vision is 		clear - to enhance the Kennesaw State University student 				experience by providing the resources that support successful 			learning and effective teaching. We know that there are many choices for students and faculty when purchasing course materials and other products. However, non-profit campus bookstores consistently benefit students with course materials at the lowest possible price - typically lower than for-profit stores.

<b>OUR STORE</b>
</br>
University Stores, one of the largest self-supporting enterprises at Kennesaw State University, is the leading provider of educational resources and collegiate products to the university community while enhancing student success, providing student employment opportunities, and promoting school pride and tradition.

Our business model is intended to reduce operating costs and create economies of scale, which reduces costs to our customers. Since the University Stores is owned and operated by Kennesaw State University, 100% of our profits remain on campus and are reinvested into student facilities, programs, and projects that benefit our campus community.

When you make a purchase at our Bookstore, your dollars help support programs and services that enhance the KSU student experience.
